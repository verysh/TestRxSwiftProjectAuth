This project shows my practice usage of MVVM and RxSwift.

#  Start
The application uses `node.js` as backend REST client which is running at `http://localhost:3000`.

Make sure you have `node.js` and `npm` installed.

1. `git clone https://github.com/verysh/TestRxSwiftProjectAuth.git`
2. `cd TestRxSwiftProjectAuth`
3. `npm update`
4. `node server.js`

and run `pod install` in the iOS project.

To log in, use the following credentials:
* `username`: user
* `password`: password

To get a server error, use:
* `username`: error
* `password`: any you want

To get bad credentials error, do not use any of the above cases.

#  Also application has To-Do List manager

switch to the second tab and use To-Do List manager
